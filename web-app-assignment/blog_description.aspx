                <h5>
                    What Is An Elevator Pitch? Why Is It Important For My Job Application?
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Generally, an elevator pitch is a short and persuasive speech to introduce yourself, your product, or your company. The ‘elevator pitch’ name implies that your short speech should be presented during a quick elevator ride: 30-seconds long at maximum. <br /> <br />

                    The elevator pitch is important to quickly spark an interest in who you are and what you do. In the case of a job application, the elevator pitch is exactly the answer to the “tell me about yourself” interview question. <br /> <br />

                    Utilising an elevator pitch for a job application is uncommon in Malaysia. Most fresh graduates apply for jobs online, so why is it relevant to you? The answer is simple – An elevator pitch can be used for multiple scenarios. For example, practicing your elevator speech can be useful when answering the “tell me about yourself” question, or even be used in your video resume.  <br /> <br />

                    Another example is that JobStreet recommends applicants to write a simple and concise pitch (300 words) to inform the hiring manager on why you’re right for the job. It is an opportunity to show that you are interested in the job and you are taking it seriously.  <br /> <br />
                </p>

                <img src="https://jobmajestic.com/blog/media/2021/03/Cover-Ultimate-Elevator-Pitch-CH-768x512.jpg" class="blogDescriptionImagePosition img-fluid"/>

                <h5>
                    Here’s How To Write The Perfect Elevator Pitch
                </h5>
                <h6>
                    1) Make It Short, Simple And Concise

                </h6>
                <p>
                    The JobStreet example above recommends a maximum limit of 300 words for your elevator pitch. However, 200 words is enough for a 30-second pitch (refer to our example below).  <br /> <br />

                    We definitely don’t recommend writing a whole essay for an elevator pitch. Make sure that your pitch is able to deliver the essence of who you are, what you do and why you matter to the company – keep it short and sweet!  <br /> <br />

                </p>
                <h6>
                    2) Show That You Have Done Your Research  
                </h6>
                
            <div class="blogDescriptionImage">
                <img src="https://jobmajestic.com/blog/media/2021/03/Cover-Ultimate-Elevator-Pitch-CH-768x512.jpg" class="blogDescriptionImagePosition img-fluid"/>
            </div>

                <p>
                    Be sure to leave an impression that you have read the correct job postings and are responding to a specific job. A big turn-off for the hiring manager is if your elevator pitch is too general and unrelated to the job posting. Personalisation is key.   <br /> <br />

                    Show that you understand what the company does, their corporate values and their business model. It would also be advantageous if you could show that you are knowledgeable in their industry. Lastly, explain why you are a perfect fit for the team, department and company.  <br /> <br />
                </p>
                <h6>
                    3) Show That You Are Good At What You Do
                </h6>
                <p>
                    Don’t be shy! This is a huge opportunity to enhance your pitch and truly shine. List out your career achievements and try to ensure that they are relevant to the current job application.  <br /> <br />

                    Whether you have doubled the sales figures, reduced employee turnover by half or increased market awareness through social media campaigns, showcase your abilities and why you are the best.    <br /> <br />

                    If you are applying for jobs that are more technical such as a copywriter, fashion designer and software engineer, show some samples of your work by including the links in your pitch. Let your work speak louder than your words. <br /> <br />
                </p>
                <h6>
                    4) Showcase Your Technical And Soft Skills
                </h6>
                <p>
                    Remember to highlight your technical and soft or intangible skills in the elevator pitch as well. Technical skills include tools, software or computer literacy skills such as AutoCAD, Office 365, Adobe Photoshop, Freshsales and more.   <br /> <br />

                    Meanwhile, soft or intangible skills refers to inner skills such as leadership skills, project management, communication skills and much more.  <br /> <br />

                </p>
                <h6>
                    5) Include Your Value Proposition <br />
                </h6>
                
            <div class="blogDescriptionImage">
                <img src="https://jobmajestic.com/blog/media/2021/03/Cover-Ultimate-Elevator-Pitch-CH-768x512.jpg" class="blogDescriptionImagePosition img-fluid"/>
            </div>

                <p>
                    Companies prefer candidates who are able to offer superior value to their organisation by solving their existing problems. Provide examples of how you solved a similar issue in your past experiences, or even share knowledge and ideas that will help to improve the company’s current product offering.  <br />  <br />

                    Try to identify their challenges and make an offer to solve them in your elevator pitch. Again, it is important for you to do your research before you include the value propositions.   <br />  <br />
                </p>
